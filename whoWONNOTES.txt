***********DIST/SRC****************
src is all our raw code DEVELOPMENT CODE DIST is for our minified code and PRODUCTION CODE

****WEBPACK FEATURES*****
WE DO NOT NEED TO INCLUDE THE SCRIPT TAG AT THE END OF THE PAGE FOR OUR INDEX FILE 
eg: <SCRIPT SRC='OUR SAME WEBPACK SCRIPT' NOT NEEDED BOYS'>


***COLORS**************************
-ONLY USE DOMINANT COLOR IN A LIMITED NUMBER OF PLACES (PUT IT WHERE WE WANT PEOPLE TO PAY ATTENTION OR TAKE ACTION)...THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BRING FOCUS 

-USE ACCENT COLORS TO HIGHLIGHT QUOTES BUTTONS OR SUBTITLES (USE 1 / 2)

~~~~BASE COLOR~~~
DOMINANT COLOR: #A65453
ACCENT COLOR: #574C4C
-BACKGROUND-COLOR: #F3F3EE

***********TEXT******************
Never choose a background that makes your text or content hard to read.“
BLACK TEXT IS COOL —ONLY USE COLORED BODY TEXT WHEN ON HIGHLETED BACKGROUND 


***********FONTS**************
-USING CUSTOM FONTS 
use EG:
@font-face {
    font-family: fontName;
    src: url(location)
}

***REM AND EM****
While em is relative to the font-size of its direct or nearest parent, rem is only relative to the html (root) font-size. REM: IS FOR ROOT BOYS REMEMBER THAT 


**********HTML DESIGN******************
-Give similar items same class name but differentiate them through #ids 
-eg: we're using .player_card for both player cards but give them #card_o #card_1, 
this also works for an active class so we can toggle it between the two without having to do so much code.
